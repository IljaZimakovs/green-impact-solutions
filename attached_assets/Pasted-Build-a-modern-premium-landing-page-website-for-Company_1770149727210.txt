About:
We are a product engineering company focused on building connected devices, scalable software platforms, and AI-powered applications. We deliver complete end-to-end solutions from custom hardware and firmware to cloud infrastructure and user-facing mobile and web applications. We work with individuals, startups, product companies building smart devices, IoT platforms, and intelligent digital products requiring tight integration between hardware, cloud, and applications.

Core Expertise:
- Embedded firmware for ESP32, STM32, ARM-based and custom boards
- IoT connectivity + cloud integration using MQTT and AWS IoT Core
- Mobile apps: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin
- AI SaaS + web platforms: React, Next.js, Node.js, Python (OpenAI/RAG)
- PCB design, hardware bring-up, real-time systems, protocols (UART/SPI/I2C), drivers
- Cloud deployments, DevOps, CI/CD on AWS and GCP

GOALS:
1) Premium, enterprise-ready look
2) Immediately communicate "hardware → firmware → cloud → mobile/web → AI"
3) Convert visitors into leads (primary CTA: Start a Project; secondary CTA: Book a Call)
4) Fast, responsive, SEO-friendly, accessible

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Calm, simple, clean design (no neon colors, no heavy gradients)
- Use neutral backgrounds (white/off-white) + soft grays
- Use ONE accent color (deep blue or slate) for buttons and links
- Use natural, clean images (engineering team, devices, modern offices, hardware lab, dashboards) — do NOT use cartoon illustrations
- Use generous whitespace, premium typography, subtle shadows, rounded corners
- Subtle animations only (fade in, hover lift). No flashy effects.
- Overall vibe: minimal, trustworthy, modern engineering studio.

TECH REQUIREMENTS:
- React.js (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Component-based structure
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, aria labels, good contrast, focus states
- SEO: metadata for the landing page (title, description, OpenGraph)
- Use local placeholder images or simple gradient placeholders (don’t depend on external image links that may break)
- Include a contact form UI (front-end only) with validation and success message.
